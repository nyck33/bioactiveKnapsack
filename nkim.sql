The trend barely remained till Edo period.After the civilization meat-eating habit regained gradually but it did not become popular among people till the end of the world war.There are 4 Japanese species called Wagyu, which were crossbred of native and foreigh species for meat. The 4 species areJapanese black, Japanese brown, Japanese shorthorn and Japanese polled.Japanese black occupies most of the market.Holstein is dairy cattle. The meat is lean. It takes less time to maturity.The production of crossbred of Japanese species and holstein is increasing.Most beef imported are coming from USA and Australia.They are divided into primal cuts and imported frozen or cooled.About 60% of beef consumed in Japan is imported and the rest of 40% is produced in Japan. The ratio of species produced in Japan is in 6 to 4. 6 is occupied by dairy cattle like holstein raised for meat. 4 is by wagyu and wagyu hybrid. Wagyu meat is marbled and tender.The definition of domestic cattle is that the cattle which is raised in Japan for the certain period of time regardless of the species.The famous wagyu brands are Matsusaka (Mie prefecture), Omi (Shiga prefecture), Hitachi (Ibaragi prefecture), Yonezawa (Yamagata prefecture), Kobe (Hyogo prefecture) and so on. The differences among those branded beef are not the species or birth places but the methods of raising.The branded beef is highly evaluated in its quality for the marbling.Dairy bull cattle:the most commonly sold beef with the label of domestically raised. In most cases the speices is holstein and the raising period is 20 months. The meat is lean.Culled cow cattle are also slaughtered for meat.The hybrid of dairy cow and wagyu male are on the market.Imported beef:Since the lifting of import ban in 1991, the volume increased rapidly till it occupies the half of the beef market now. Not to be forgotten is the problem of BSE (Bovine Spongeform Encephalopathy).The meat from calves younger than 6 months is called veal. Veal is commonly used in French cuisine but not in Japan.The nutrition facts of beef are indicated specifically with the amout of fat included in each part considered.', 'The tips to choose tasty beef:See if the texture is smooth and tight, if the reddness of lean meat is glossy, if the fat is white or milky white.Sirloin is a part of the highest grade as well as filet. It is the tenderest for its marbling and the fine texture.TongueIt is high in fat and also contains a lot of viamin B2 and iron. It has a good texture which turns tender when simmered. Suitable cookings are grill or stew.RumpIt is low in fat and the texture is smooth, a suitable part for grilled steak. But however it is cooked, it will be delicious.Shank:It is chewy but rich in flavour, a suitable part for stew beause of tendons.Loin:The texture is smooth and tender for its marbling, a suitable part for sukiyaki, syabusyabu, roast beef.Filet:It is low in fat and tender distinctively. It is the part of highest grade. The filet occupies only 3 % of the whole meat obtained from one cattle. It is a suitable part for grill.Ribs:The lean and fat are layered. It is a suitable part for stew due to thick taste.Thigh:The texture is rather tough, a suitale part for roast or grill.Chunk meat can be preserved in a freezer for about 2 months. Dripps produced in the course of thawing degrade the flavor. It is important to take time to thaw frozen meat.Hearts:It is crispy without distinctive smell. It is a part suitable for grill with skewers.Lever:The biggest organ. In order to remove the distinctive smell, draining the blood before cooking is recommended. It is rich in vitamin A, vitamin B group and iron. Fresh lever is resilient and glossy dark red. It is suitable for being grilled or made into paste.Kidney:It is also called bean because of the form. It contains little fat but is rich in vitamin B group and iron. Good liver is resilient and smooth on the surface. Suitable for stir-fry and soup.Rumen:stomach chamber 1. The biggest part in the stomach. When cut opened, the shape is triangler. It is thick and densely covered with cilia. Grilled or simmered.Reticulum, stomach chamber 2The paries is covered with honeycomed layers. Most tasty among tripes. Cooking follows after washing with lye water and boiling to remve the slime.Omasum:stomach chamber 3it has omasal laminae, which are made of thin muscular layers covered with a nonglandular mucous membrane. It contains more iron than lever does.Abomasum:stomach chamber 4The wall is thinner and softer than other stomach chambers.Intestine:The length is 30 to 40 cm. It is fatty and chewy.Prior to cooking, cleaning inside the wall is necessary.Large intestine:It is often sold as \'\'motsu\'\' with chopped small intestine. It is easy to digest. After the fat inside of the colon is removed, it is cooked with miso.rectumit is called \'\'a pistol\'\', because the form is similar to it when cut open. It is tender and rich in taste.

Suitable for stew or oden.uterus, womb:The parts eaten are layers which form uterus. Suitable for grill or stew.Tail:Collagen is found in bone marrow and skin. Oxtail is cut by ligament and cooked.

When cooked at home, remove the fat so the amount contained will be same as in the shoulder meat 20g/100gRibroast contains a lot of fat.\'\'Syabusyabu\'\' is a good way of eating eibroast to reduce the fat intake. The important thing is to refrain from eating the soup after syabusyabu because cholesterol is dissolving.Marbled meat is willingly used for syabusyabu. It follows that the amount of fat intake is calculated as almost half the amout of meat eaten.Poultry is a source of good protain, vitamin and minerals.

When heated, the weight decreases because the water evaporates and the fat melts and drips.When chicken with bone is cooked, the bone slows the heat conduction, inhibits the contraction of the muscle, and keeps the inner temperature rather low, about 76 degree. That is why chicken with bone is softer and more juicy than chicken without bone when cooked. When cooked on large scale, the heat temperature is targeted 75 degree in the center.

And the import is increasing.About 55% of the global catch of tunas are consumed by Japanese people.Among tunas, Thunnus thynnus is regarded as king of tunas and most tasty. It grows to 3m in length and reaches 500 kg in weight.The population of tunas in the wild has been drastically decreasing because the demand for tunas has rised recently in the world. For that, the catch limit on tunas is becoming stricter all over the world. Meanwhile the acquaculture technology is developping drastically which is worthy of attention. In near future, the quality of farmed tunas will be comparable to tunas grown in the wild.It is a migratory fish, and approaches very close to coasts in some season. The spawning occurrs in spring to summer. The spawning spots are formed in three regions. One is near Florida in West Atlantic, near Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea, and near the Philippines to Taiwan. There is a theory to classify tunas as a different species or as a subspecies according to the producing areas, the Pacific or Atlantic. In that case, the Pacific tuna is indicated as T. orientalis or T. thynnus orientalis.The fry hatched in the spawning area of the Pacific Ocean stay there until they grow to 10cm in length.
