Among the species, ''Aotaigun'' is a slow ripening type, and strong agaist heat and diseases. It was raised in such a way as letting it sprawl on straw bedding. The ground creeping species''Aonagagun'' was cultivated in force until 1970.Cucumbers of North China species have white-dotted spines and are harvested in summer. The skin is thin and the texture is crispy.In order to harvest summer cucumbers in spring, the cultivation method to accelerate growth was developped. A shoot of summer cucumber was grafted onto a stock of squash. This enabled a summer cucumber ''Tokiwa'' to bear fruits in spring.North China cucumbers have female flowers on stable basis in summer when daylight hours are long. That makes the cultivation easy in spring and summer.''Sannjyaku cucumbers''are North China type.They are crispy and refreshing.Breeding between South China cucumbers and North China brought about hybrids which have mixed characters. ''Kema''cultivated in Kansai, Hokuriku , Tohoku, ''Shogoin''in Kyoto, ''Kariwa''in Niigata are spring hybrids, and ''Shindome''is a summer hybrid.''Shindome'' has the crispy flesh.

When heated, the weight decreases because the water evaporates and the fat melts and drips.When chicken with bone is cooked, the bone slows the heat conduction, inhibits the contraction of the muscle, and keeps the inner temperature rather low, about 76 degree. That is why chicken with bone is softer and more juicy than chicken without bone when cooked. When cooked on large scale, the heat temperature is targeted 75 degree in the center.
